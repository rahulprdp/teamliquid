We had interviews with some of the doctors from a local clinic to find out what their current situation is, what kind of features they want and how this will help them.

**Sarath Krishna M , Doctor.**

> "As a doctor having easy access to patient history, check a day's schedule is really helpful. To have all the test reports at one place could make work easy. From the patient perspective if they could book via a medium we could avoid waiting in the clinic."

**Shafnas , Assistant Doctor**

> "A Cash Registrar feature and Patient registrar feature will be really helpful to maintain the daily records. It would be easy to monitor the progress of the treatment and know the expenses and medicines given till date"
